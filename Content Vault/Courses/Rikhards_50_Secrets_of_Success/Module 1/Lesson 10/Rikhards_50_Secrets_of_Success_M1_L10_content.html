<p>Section 1: Train Your Brain to See Money This lesson is more about thinking - real business awareness. So always, when I walk into a business - for example, when I walk into a clothing store - I start thinking: How is this business running? Are they making money? How many staff are there? How much are they paying for rent? What’s the price of their products compared to what they probably paid to get them? You should be thinking about money automatically. That’s the point. You need to train your brain to do that without effort. When you walk into a coffee shop, same thing - how busy is it, how many people are working, what’s the average price per customer, what’s their most profitable item? This kind of thinking should become your default. You should be doing it everywhere you go - restaurants, gyms, car washes, even online stores. It’s not about judging the business - it’s about training your brain to see how money moves. Average people never do this. They walk in, buy something, and leave. You walk in and study how the business works. That’s the difference. That’s how you start building real business awareness. Because once you think like this all the time, you start seeing opportunities other people completely miss.</p>

<p>Section 2: Why Most People Never Think Like This Most people don’t think like this - ever. They walk into a business, buy something, leave, and that’s it. No awareness. No questions. No curiosity. They never stop to ask: “How much did this cost them to make?” “Are they actually making money here?” “Could I run this better?” And that’s why they stay stuck. Because the truth is - most people live inside businesses their whole life… but never actually see how they work. They work jobs inside a system. They shop inside another system. But they never take a step back and analyze it. They’re surrounded by businesses - but never learn business. That’s why I’m telling you - you have to train your brain to think like an owner, everywhere you go. Even if you never want to open a coffee shop, you should still be able to walk into one and figure out how it works. That’s how you build real understanding. That’s how you start thinking like someone who builds things - not someone who just consumes.</p>

<p>Section 3: How to Think Like an Owner Anywhere You Go Here’s a simple way to break it down. Anytime you walk into a business, run this four-step process in your head: 1. Observe – Look around. What type of business is this? What are they selling? Who’s buying? What’s the vibe? 2. Estimate – Start guessing the numbers. How much is rent here? How many staff? What do they pay them? How much do they make per customer? 3. Analyze – What’s working? What’s not? Is the design good? Is the pricing smart? Are they upselling? Do customers look happy? 4. Improve – Think: if this was yours - what would you do better? What would you cut? What would you add? That’s it. You don’t need to know everything. But just running this process every time you go out will build your instincts fast. You’ll start noticing things others don’t. You’ll start seeing how businesses actually run - not just what they sell. And over time, that builds sharp decision-making. You’ll have way better judgment when it’s time to start your own thing - because you’ve been training your brain the whole time.</p>

<p>Section 4: What You Should Do Today I want you to go over that list every single time you walk into a store. Every time. You’ll see - once you actually do it, you’ll be shocked how fast your thinking changes. You don’t need to own the business. You just need to walk in and run the process: Observe. Estimate. Analyze. Improve. Do it everywhere - coffee shop, gas station, gym, sneaker store, wherever. You’ll start seeing numbers. You’ll start noticing who’s making money and who’s wasting time. Me and my boys do this all the time. We’ll walk into a place, and without even saying it out loud - we’re already thinking: “Yo, rent here must be insane. Labor cost probably killing them. They need to upsell harder.” Or like, “This spot’s empty for a reason. Poor layout. Weak offer. No identity.” That’s just how we talk now. Every conversation turns into business. Every outing is a breakdown. Every city is a lesson. That’s what happens when your brain’s wired right. You don’t need a classroom - the world is the classroom.</p>

<p>Section 5: Who You Become When This Is Automatic When this becomes automatic, you stop walking through life like a customer. You stop buying things without thinking. You stop moving blind. You walk into a business, and your brain clicks on - not because you’re trying, but because it’s who you are now. You see systems. You see mistakes. You see margins. You don’t need someone to teach you - you’re teaching yourself everywhere you go. This is how real entrepreneurs are made. Not by watching YouTube videos all day - but by paying attention in the real world. Once this mindset clicks, you’ll realize how zombie-headed everyone else is. You’ll be walking through the same store, but seeing something completely different. They see coffee. You see overhead. They see shelves. You see strategy. They see product. You see profit. And when you finally start your own thing - you won’t be guessing. You’ll already know how to think, how to build, and how to move. Because you’ve been training for it every single day without even knowing.</p>
