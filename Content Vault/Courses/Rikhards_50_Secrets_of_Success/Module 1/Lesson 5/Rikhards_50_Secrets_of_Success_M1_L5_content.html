<p>Section 1: The Problem - You Don’t Track Anything This is so important - you need a tracking sheet for your body. If you ran your body like a business, you couldn’t fail unless you genuinely didn’t want anything good in life. Right now, you don’t track anything. You just guess. You think you’re “doing good” because you remembered to drink water. You think skipping the gym twice is fine because you meant to go. You think motivation is a strategy. It’s not. Tracking is. And the reason your body and mind are still weak is because you’ve never treated them like they matter. You want to be high-performance? Then stop running your life like a hobby. Run it like a company.</p>

<p>Section 2: The Shift - Run Your Life Like a Company Once you start tracking your body like a business - everything changes. No more guessing. No more “Did I do a cold shower yesterday?” “Did I hit training today?” You’ll know - because it’s right in front of you. On paper. In ink. No lies. And here’s the truth: Missing is not fine. The average guy misses days and pretends it’s normal. You? You track it - so it haunts you. And I mean that literally. When you miss, I want you to mark an X like a piece of shit. You watched porn? Yeah - mark that X. You’re not porn-free. Own it. Because once it’s written down, you don’t get to forget it. It stays. It stares back at you. That’s how you stop hiding - and start rising.</p>

<p>Section 3: The System - Tracking with Brutal Honesty I’ve been doing this for over two years. Still print it. Still mark it. Still catch myself slipping here and there - sugar, scrolling, whatever. But I don’t lie to myself. Because my results aren’t emotional. They’re measurable. You are the product. You are the system. Track yourself like a company - or get left behind like one.</p>

<p>Section 4: The Proof - My Own Practice So this is where it starts. Not a journal. Not some soft little app. Just a printed tracking sheet - right in front of your face every single day. This isn’t about being productive. This is about being real. Because the man who tracks his movement can’t lie to himself anymore. Here are 10 very simple tracksheet checkpoints you can follow: • OMAD = ✔️ • Cold Shower = ✔️ • 2L Water = ✔️ • Training = ✔️ • No Porn = ✔️ • No Sugar = ✔️ • No Scrolling = ✔️ • No Junk Food = ✔️ • No Movies = ✔️ • No Videos = ✔️ You start here. or - that’s the whole game. And later, you’ll upgrade - music, sprinting, making 100K every month, whatever. But right now? Track the basics. Every day. No excuses. Just prove you can track the basics without running from yourself.</p>

<p>Professor Billy said: Section 5: The Truth - Discipline Is a System You keep saying you want more discipline. Cool. Track it. Print the sheet. Check the boxes. Face the s like a man. Because if you’re not tracking it - you’re just guessing. And if you’re guessing, you’re losing. Discipline isn’t a feeling. It’s a system. And the second you start managing yourself like a company - you stop living like a consumer. You start moving like a weapon.</p>
