<p>Section 1: The Law of Not Spending Let me tell you something nobody in business school will ever say - you can’t mess up your business if you don’t spend money. People don’t go broke because their ideas are bad. They go broke because they can’t stop spending. They start a business and instantly go into full-time spending mode. New laptop. New office. New software. New assistant. All before a single dollar comes in. And then they wonder why it falls apart. Every failure I’ve seen comes back to the same disease - too much money going out, not enough coming in. They confuse “building a business” with “buying one.” But a business isn’t something you buy - it’s something you earn. If you keep your wallet closed, you keep control. If you don’t spend, you can’t sink. You can test, learn, pivot - and survive. The moment you start throwing money at every problem, you stop thinking and start bleeding. So remember this law: The less you spend, the less you can lose. It’s not about being cheap - it’s about being alive long enough to win.</p>

<p>Section 2: The Disease of Overspending Most people don’t spend money because they need to. They spend because they’re afraid to face the work. They call it “investing in my business,” but let’s be honest - it’s just a way to feel like they’re progressing without doing the real things that move money. Buying a new laptop feels productive. Hiring a designer feels smart. Paying for another course or app feels like motion. But none of that means progress. You’re not investing - you’re escaping. You’re buying distractions to hide from the truth: that you haven’t built something that earns yet. When people start businesses, they love to spend because spending feels like control. It gives them the illusion they’re “doing something.” But control isn’t in how much you spend - control is in how long you can survive without bleeding cash. You have to understand this game: The man who can operate lean, stay alive, and keep moving with minimal costs - that’s the one who wins long-term. If you can’t separate “investment” from “escape,” you’ll drown early. You’ll keep spending until you feel broke enough to quit. Business doesn’t reward spending. It rewards results. And results don’t come from swiping your card - they come from discipline and decisions. So every time you’re about to buy something for your business, stop and ask: “Am I investing in income - or am I paying for comfort?” If it’s comfort - don’t buy it. If it’s ego - don’t buy it. If it doesn’t make money - don’t buy it. This is how you stay alive long enough to build something real.</p>

<p>Section 3: The Escape of Spending When I first started making money, I didn’t have a plan. No system. No budget. Just motion. And like most people, the moment cash started coming in, I started spending. Little things here and there - new clothes, new tech, eating out - anything that made me feel like I was winning. Then I went bigger. I bought myself a BMW M5 and started spending like an ATM machine. Every weekend, every bar, every flex - it felt good at the time. But when the Facebook Marketplace changed in Iceland, everything flipped overnight. The income slowed down, and I realized how reckless I’d been. If I hadn’t bought that M5… If I had kept that money and invested it into something real… I’d have been a multi-millionaire at twenty. That moment changed everything for me. It taught me that money doesn’t make you powerful - discipline does. Anyone can make money fast, but keeping it and growing it? That’s the real game. You’re lucky to be here inside this program. Because I’m giving you every lesson I learned the hard way - every mistake, every truth - so you can skip the pain and build faster. So take this seriously: Save before you spend. Build before you buy. Protect before you play. You don’t need to learn this the hard way like I did. You already have the blueprint. Now it’s on you to use it.</p>

<p>Section 4: The % Rule - Control Your Cash Before It Controls You Money isn’t hard to make. The real skill is keeping it. Most people don’t go broke because they fail - they go broke because they can’t stop spending like amateurs. So here’s the rule I live by now - the 50 / 30 / 20 Rule. It’s not random. It’s survival. 50% - Reinvest into What Makes More Money Half of everything you earn should go straight back into things that multiply cash - ads, leads, tools, systems, or people who generate income. If a dollar doesn’t create more dollars, it’s dead. That’s your weapon money. 30% - Protect and Operate This is for what keeps the business alive - bills, subscriptions, basic tools, operations. The boring stuff that matters. Don’t let it go higher than 30%. If it does, you’re feeding overhead instead of profit. 20% - Personal Freedom This is your reward - what you live on, what you save, what you enjoy. But it’s capped. Because until your income is huge, your lifestyle can’t be. The goal isn’t to live big early. It’s to stay alive long enough to build something big. When you follow this % rule, your business becomes bulletproof. You’ll always have motion, always have backup, always have growth. But the second you flip it - spend 80% to look rich and reinvest 20% hoping to fix it later - you’re finished. Control your cash before it controls you. Because once the money starts bleeding, you can’t stop it. Remember: It’s not about how much you make - it’s about how much you keep.</p>

<p>Section 5: Flexing vs. Freedom And listen - no one’s saying you can’t drive supercars or live in penthouses. That’s the reward for playing the game right. But there’s no point flexing when you’re stressed out, losing sleep, and watching your business crumble. Don’t buy freedom if it comes with panic. Only spend when you’re truly ready - when your money works harder than you do. Make no mistake - I’m not telling you that you can’t live like a king. I’m telling you: don’t act like one before you’ve built your kingdom. Don’t start spending the second money hits your account. Save it. Use it to grow the business until the business starts feeding you back. Because when your systems are running and the income moves without you, then you can live however you want. That’s when the lifestyle is real - when the business is working for you, not the other way around. You can drive the car, buy the watch, take the trip - and never feel stress about it again. That’s the difference between flexing and freedom. So don’t rush the reward. Build first, enjoy forever.</p>
