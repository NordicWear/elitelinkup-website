<p>Section 1: Reframe “Broke” - They’re Not Out of Money, You’re Out of Rank Let’s start with the truth most people avoid: When someone says, “I can’t afford it,” it’s almost never about money. It’s about priority. People spend on what matters to them - right now. Rent. Food. Streaming subscriptions. Nights out. A “small treat” that costs more than your product. They’re not broke. They’ve just ranked other things higher than what you’re offering. That’s your real job as a marketer or creator - not to convince people they have money, but to outrank everything else in their mental spending order. To make your offer sit right next to life’s essentials. Think about it like this: Everyone has an internal list that decides where their dollars go. Your offer belongs at the top of that list - not buried under things they’ll forget by Friday. So instead of asking, “How do I get them to buy?” Ask, “How do I make this the one thing they can’t not buy?” Once you see it that way, everything changes - your copy, your energy, your close. You stop begging for attention and start earning priority. Because the truth is, no one’s really broke. They’re just spending on what feels like the top priority. Your job is to be that.</p>

<p>Section 2: Why They Buy “Other Stuff” Let’s get real about buying behavior - people always find the money for what feels urgent, exciting, or emotionally rewarding. It’s not about having money; it’s about what feels like it deserves it. When someone says they can’t afford your offer, remember - they are buying something else instead. They’re investing in the experiences, comforts, or distractions that give them the feeling they want right now. That’s the key. Every purchase is emotional math. They ask themselves: “Does this make me feel better, safer, more powerful, or more seen?” If the answer’s yes, they’ll swipe the card - every time. So your job isn’t to lecture them on priorities. It’s to translate your offer into their emotional language. Show them how what you’re selling gives them that same feeling - but in a smarter, longer-lasting way. People don’t buy products. They buy what those products represent: status, relief, freedom, certainty, identity. If your message connects to that, you stop fighting for attention and start leading the conversation. Because at the end of the day, no one’s choosing against you - they’re just choosing what feels most aligned with who they are. Your job is to make your offer feel like them.</p>

<p>Section 3: Outranking the Essentials - The Promise of “More Later” Here’s the mindset shift that changes everything: People don’t stop buying essentials - they just redefine what essential means. Rent keeps its spot. Food stays high on the list. But when something new promises more of those essentials - more security, more freedom, more control - it starts climbing that ranking fast. That’s the lever you pull. Your offer shouldn’t compete against people’s priorities. It should feed them. Show how what you’re selling leads to “more later.” More income. More peace. More status. More energy. When your offer connects to a future surplus - it stops feeling like a cost and starts feeling like a strategy. People love the idea of future gain. They’ll stretch their budget for something that multiplies what they already value. So position your offer as the thing that gives them more of what they never want to lose. You’re not asking them to trade money for a maybe. You’re showing them how this purchase protects or expands what matters most. That’s the promise of “more later.” And when your audience believes that, price stops being the blocker - because the outcome feels like a return.</p>

<p>Section 4: Objection Flips That Print Here’s the truth: objections aren’t resistance - they’re curiosity wearing armor. When someone says, “I can’t afford it,” they’re really saying, “I don’t fully believe the payoff yet.” And that’s your cue to lead, not lower the price. Instead of arguing, reframe. Turn the cost conversation into a value conversation. Because the real question isn’t “Can they afford it?” It’s “Can they afford not to?” If your offer helps them save time, make money, or stop bleeding energy - then not joining is actually the expensive choice. Here’s how you flip it: → “It’s too expensive.” Right - and staying stuck costs even more. Let’s talk about what that’s really costing you per month. → “Now’s not the right time.” Totally get that. But when’s the last time ‘later’ magically made things easier? → “I need to think about it.” Of course - and the best way to think clearly is with momentum, not hesitation. Notice the pattern? You’re not being pushy. You’re showing perspective. You’re reframing the purchase as a power move - a signal that they’re done renting their progress. The goal isn’t to crush objections. It’s to build conviction. Because when they feel the value - not just hear it - the objection dissolves on its own.</p>

<p>Section 5: Recession Reality Check - Vices Don’t Dip Let’s talk about what really happens when the economy tightens. People say, “No one’s buying right now.” But look closer - that’s never fully true. Even in a downturn, people still buy what they want. The categories might shift, but the desire doesn’t disappear. Vices don’t dip - they just disguise themselves as “little treats” or “non-negotiables.” Streaming subscriptions grow. Coffee shops stay packed. Beauty, gaming, and entertainment - all rise when times get hard. Why? Because people are still searching for relief, connection, and escape. That never goes away. So here’s the lesson: You don’t need to chase scarcity messaging - you need to align with desire. When you understand what people crave during uncertainty, you can position your offer as emotional relief that makes sense. Frame your offer as something that protects stability, builds resilience, or gives them a sense of control when everything else feels unpredictable. You’re not selling a want - you’re meeting a need that just got louder. Recession or not, people buy what helps them feel safe or stay sane. If your offer does that, it won’t just survive hard times - it’ll thrive because of them.</p>

<p>Section 6: The Ritual - Make Them Choose You Over Everything Else By now, you know the truth - people always have money for what they value. Your job is to make your offer the obvious choice. Not through pressure, not through hype - but through clarity, proof, and power. Think of this as a ritual - a sequence you follow to earn that top spot in their mind: Step 1: Lead with the Outcome. Start every message with what they truly want - not what you’re selling. Show them the end result they’ve been chasing, and position your offer as the shortcut. Step 2: Back it with Proof. Stories, numbers, transformations - whatever validates that your outcome is real. Proof is the bridge between curiosity and conviction. Step 3: Close with Ownership. End every pitch by reminding them that change requires a choice. Invite them to choose differently this time - to choose themselves. That’s how you make people move. You don’t manipulate them into a “yes.” You help them recognize it was always theirs to give. Because when your message is clear, your offer is essential, and your conviction is louder than their doubt - they’ll choose you, over everything else. That’s the ritual. Simple. Repeatable. Powerful. Now, take this framework, apply it to your next offer, and watch what happens when you stop selling - and start ranking first.</p>
