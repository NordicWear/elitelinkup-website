<p>Section 1: The Core Rule - It Ain’t Real Till It’s in Your Bank It ain’t real money in your pocket unless it’s in your bank account. I learned that the hard way. Back when I was broke and grinding on Facebook Marketplace in Iceland, hungry as hell - literally - I’d celebrate every “buyer” who said they were coming. Thought I had it made a dozen times over. But half the time, they’d flake. Ghost me. I was counting money that wasn’t mine yet. Living off hope, not cash. That taught me something real: potential doesn’t pay rent. Promises don’t buy food. Now, I don’t care what someone says they’ll pay or what’s “on the way.” If it’s not in my account, it’s not real. Everything else? Hype. Illusion.</p>

<p>Section 2: The Marketplace Story - Broke, Hungry, and Learning the Hard Way Back then, every sale felt like survival. I was living off scraps and screenshots - waiting for messages that might save me for another day. Every “yeah bro, I’m on my way” felt like a miracle. I’d start counting the profit in my head before they even showed up. But most of them never did. Half of those “buyers” were just talk - no-show, no message, no money. That’s when I realized: I wasn’t just broke. I was believing in ghosts. The hustle wasn’t the problem - my belief was. I was betting on words instead of deposits. Hoping instead of holding. That was the moment I learned one of the coldest truths in business - until the money clears, you don’t have a sale. You have a story.</p>

<p>Section 3: The Lesson - Potential Doesn’t Pay Rent That whole phase burned one truth into my head: potential doesn’t pay rent. Promises don’t buy food. It doesn’t matter how close the deal sounds. Doesn’t matter how excited they seem. If the money hasn’t landed, you’re still broke. People will hype you up, promise to “send it tomorrow,” talk about “once the invoice is approved,” or “once the investor signs.” All noise. None of it feeds you. Potential is the most expensive drug in the game - it keeps you high on what might happen, while you starve on what isn’t. Now, I treat every deal the same: no emotion, no celebration, no trust - just transaction. If the money hits, cool. If not, next.</p>

<p>Professor Billy said: Section 4: The Rule Applied - Don’t Celebrate Early So whenever you're trying to sell something, make sure the money actually hits your bank account - first. Don’t celebrate early. Don’t count it until it’s real. Only celebrate when the payment clears - and even then, just for a few seconds. Then it’s on to the next sale. That’s it. Keep it moving. That’s how you build real momentum. Not by talking about what’s coming, but by stacking what’s cleared. Every deposit is a receipt of reality - proof that your motion worked. Because in this game, excitement without income is just entertainment. Ready for the next section?</p>

<p>Section 5: The Reality Check - Contracts and Promises Mean Nothing This is crucial. It doesn’t matter what they promise. Doesn’t matter if they’ve signed a contract. None of it means anything until the money lands. People love to talk big. They’ll tell you, “It’s coming soon,” or “The deal’s basically done.” They’ll send you screenshots, invoices, even PDFs with their logo on it - all fake comfort. It’s not real until the money is sitting in your bank account. Period. Everything else is a fantasy people tell themselves so they don’t have to face the truth: talk is cheap.</p>

<p>Section 6: The Illusion of “Soon Money” I remember so many times I used to fantasize about money coming in. Every time I thought I had a big deal lined up, I’d start planning - thinking about what I’d do, how I’d spend it. I even told my mom I was going to take her on vacation soon. But that’s the trap - “soon money.” The illusion that it’s already yours. You start spending it in your head, bragging to yourself, feeling rich off a dream. That’s when I realized how dangerous imagination can be when it’s mixed with desperation. “Soon” is where most people die - stuck waiting for what never arrives.</p>

<p>Section 7: The Wake-Up Punch - When Fantasy Collapses Every time a deal fell through, it felt like a punch to the face - a hard reminder of how stupid I was for counting on it too soon. You sit there replaying every message, every promise, thinking maybe they’ll come through this time. But they don’t. And that’s when reality hits - all the energy you spent dreaming could’ve gone into finding the next real buyer. That’s the wake-up punch. The moment you realize hope doesn’t pay bills. The moment you stop chasing “maybe” and start demanding proof. I needed those hits. Every flake, every ghost, every fake “buyer” - they trained me to stop believing in almost.</p>

<p>Section 8: The Final Commandment - Never Count It Till It Clears So never, ever, ever think it’s real until it’s sitting in your bank account. Not when they promise. Not when they say “it’s coming.” Not when they send a screenshot. Only when it clears. That’s the line between fantasy and fact - between thinking you’re winning and actually winning. And yeah, when it does clear? You’re allowed to feel it. You earned that moment. Smile. Breathe. Let it hit for a few seconds - the validation, the proof, the silence after the grind. But then? Move. Don’t build a shrine around one sale. The second you celebrate too long, the motion dies. Because the money isn’t the goal - the momentum is. You celebrate for a few seconds, then you go get the next one. That’s the discipline that separates the dreamers from the earners. Ready for the next section?</p>
